# Deadsimple Shopify 💰

A dead-simple shopify theme with killer DX and web perf 👨🏻‍💻🏇🏻✨

*This project is a WIP, I wouldn't recommend using it yet*

## Features
With Shopify's Slate now deprecated, The main value of this theme, is to modernize & streamline the development experience of Shopify themes.  

With that in mind, I've left the theme intentionally simple, and is meant to act as a "starter" (similar to the underscores theme in wordpressland) with some killer DX stuff builtin from the start. 

Here's a list of the key features today:
- **🏪 Multiple Themes & Store Configs:** Configurable with different shopify themes & storefronts, comes out of the box with infra for dev, staging, and production stores. 
- **🛠 Webpack Support:** A Modern Webpack setup with sane defaults out of the box. This can be easily extended to support most modern JS needs (React, Vue, Typescript, etc)
- **🕵️‍♀️ Eslint Support:** Eslint setup with sane defaults out of the box. This can easily be replaced with your existing EsLint setup or stripped out all together. 
- **💾 Easy Deploy & Dev Scripts:** Easily develop your store using `npm run dev` which will open your dev theme in your browser, watches for changes to your theme files & JS with for seamless updates as you write code. While this isn't local dev like Slate offered, it *feels* close. 
- **🧪 E2E testing with Cypress.io:** End to End testing setup with Cypress to make sure your site stays in great shape when you make changes.
